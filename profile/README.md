**Unblocked Games: What They Are and the Top 30 Popular Games You Can Play**

Unblocked games are online games that can be played even in environments where internet access or gaming sites are restricted, such as at schools or workplaces. These games bypass web filtering systems, allowing users to access them without encountering blocks. They have become increasingly popular because they provide an opportunity for entertainment and relaxation during free time, especially in environments where gaming is usually not allowed.
